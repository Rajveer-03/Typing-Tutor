A good example of that approach is Sproull Kieslers filter model of CMC, which focuses
on the technological or engineering features of e-mail
and other forms of computer-based.
According to this perspective, CMC limits the bandwidth of social,
settings (or to telephone interaction, which at least occurs in
real time and includes important nonverbal features of speech).
Sproull & Kiesler (1985) considered CMC to be an impoverished
experience, with the reduction of available social cues
resulting in a greater sense or feeling of anonymity.
This in turn is said to have a deindividuating effect on
the individuals involved, producing behavior that is
more self-centered and less socially regulated than usual.
This reduced-information model of Internet assumes further
have negative effects on social interaction
(i.e., a weaker, relatively impoverished social interaction).
Note also that this engineering or bandwidth model assumes that the channel effects of Internet
communication are the same for all users and across all contexts in other words,
it predicts a main effect of channel.
